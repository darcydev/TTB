								<h2>About Monkerai Bridge</h2>
								<p>
									Monkerai Bridge over the Karuah River is a 70‘ (21 m) Bennett
									Truss (also called Old PWD – Public Works Department – truss)
									located on a little used unsealed road in a remote rural
									setting about 22 km northeast of Dungog. It was originally
									completed in 1882. The bridge had extensive modifications made
									to it over the years which damaged both its structural
									performance and heritage integrity. It was in a state of
									disrepair and closed to traffic from 2004 to 2020. Monkerai
									Bridge was fully upgraded in 2019, taking approximately
									sixteen months to completion and reopening to traffic in May
									2020.
								</p>
								<p>
									Monkerai Bridge is of State significance as the second oldest
									surviving timber truss road bridge in New South Wales. It is
									rare and representative as the only remaining example of a 70’
									Bennett truss and as one of only two remaining examples of
									Bennett trusses of approximately 150 built. William
									Christopher Bennett was the designer of this truss type.
									Bennett was recognised as one of the ablest officers in the
									government service, and held the position of Commissioner and
									Chief Engineer to the Roads Department of the New South Wales
									Department of Public Works from 1862 until 1889.
								</p>
								<p>
									Bennett trusses are historically significant as the first of
									the five stages of timber truss road bridge design in New
									South Wales, which proved and popularised the timber truss as
									the preferred form of bridge construction for medium span
									bridges in New South Wales. It is historically significant
									through its association with the expansion of the State road
									network, and the contribution of that road system to
									settlement, development and economic activity. At the time the
									Bennett trusses were being built hardwoods were plentiful in
									NSW. The design is an example of innovative and practical
									engineering in a time when large and long old growth timbers
									were readily available and vast numbers of bridges were being
									built on a tight budget.
								</p>
								<p>
									The bridge is approximately 100 m long and 5.5 m wide,
									consisting of three timber girder approach spans of varying
									lengths (approximately 8.5 m, 12.2 m and 12.3 m respectively)
									and three 70’ (21.336 m) Bennett type truss spans. The six
									spans are supported on five timber trestle piers and two
									timber abutments. It was designed to carry a single lane of
									traffic.

										>The diagram shows the general arrangement of Monkerai
										Bridge</span

								</div>
								<p>
									Monkerai Bridge is one example of the Bennett design which has
									performed well beyond the expectations of the original
									designer, with the average life of the Bennett Truss being 54
									years, 26 bridges remaining in service beyond 80 years, and
									only two still remaining today after 135 years.
								</p>
								<h2>Timeline</h2>
								<h4>Pre 1800s</h4>
								<p>
									For thousands of years prior to the arrival of Europeans the
									Karuah Valley was, and still is, inhabited by the Worimi, who
									lived a vibrant healthy lifestyle afforded by foods of the
									valley like kangaroo, fish and yabbies from the local waters.
									The Worimi are members of the Gathang (gu-thung) language
									group, the language spoken from as far south as Port Stephens
									to Port Macquarie in the north.
								</p>
								<p>
									Recent artefacts identified at the Monkerai Bridge site
									indicate Worimi activity in the immediate area. The artefacts
									were uncovered on the nearby flood plains and included several
									hammer stones and cores used for making sharp flakes for tools
									and spear points. The hammer stones appear to be cobbles
									sourced from the Karuah River.
								</p>
								<h4>1820s</h4>
								<p>
									W.C Bennett (bridge designer) is born in Ireland on 4th July
									1824. In the same year, the Australian Agricultural Company is
									grated 1 million acres from Port Stephens to the Manning River
									for agricultural farming. The estate included the Karuah River
									and Gloucester River Valleys. Robert Dawson, Chief Agent for
									the Australian Agricultural Company, arrived with the first
									group of 79 settlers to explore the country around Maitland
									and Newcastle.
								</p>
								<h4>1850s</h4>
								<p>
									Cedar cutters move into the area seeking the valuable timber.
									Logs felled from the surrounding valley are transported by
									bullock wagon and steam train to be shipped to Port Stephens.
									In 1855 the first timber truss bridge was constructed in NSW
									at Carcoar, and Bennett arrived in NSW the same year, having
									worked in Ireland, Central America, England and New Zealand.
								</p>
								<h4>1870s</h4>
								<p>
									The Weismantels-Dingadee Road (now Monkerai Road) through the
									Monkerai Valley is the main road link between the villages of
									Dungog, Gloucester and Stroud, and is the best route to the
									Barrington goldfields. However, the road is often impassable
									for days in times of heavy rain and flood. Gold is discovered
									in 1875 by timber collectors in the Barrington Tops region
									which sees miners flock to the area. In 1878 gravel begin
									being laid down to improve the roads and a new Monkerai Hill
									road is built.
								</p>
								<h4>1882</h4>
								<p>Monkerai Bridge is opened.</p>
								<h4>1889</h4>
								<p>
									W.C. Bennett dies on 29th September 1889, having overseen the
									construction of nearly 16,000 km of roads in NSW and nearly 65
									km of bridges (including approximately 150 Bennett type timber
									truss bridges).
								</p>
								<h4>1890</h4>
								<p>
									Most of the gold mining activity had ceased by this time and
									overcutting of cedar leads to a depletion of supplies.
								</p>
								<h4>2004</h4>
								<p>
									The bridge closes to traffic due to safety concerns from
									deterioration.
								</p>
								<h4>2020</h4>
								<p>
									The bridge is reopened after a $15M refurbishment, bringing
									Bennett’s original design back into service with strength and
									safety improvements.
