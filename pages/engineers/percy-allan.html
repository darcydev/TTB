								<h2>
									William Christopher Bennett (1824 – 1889): The Bridge Engineer
								</h2>
								<p>
									William Christopher Bennett was born in Ireland on the 4th of
									July 1824. He was employed on the territorial and railway
									surveys and drainage works in Ireland and by the age of twenty
									two he had four or five thousand men under him and was acting
									as District Engineer. He worked in Central America, England
									and New Zealand before coming to Australia at about the age of
									thirty. Bennett was a man of courage, as can be seen from the
									following excerpt from his obituary:
								</p>
								<p class="italic">
									"Mr Bennett executed fully all the surveys and explorations
									entrusted to him, surveying and levelling by himself a large
									tract of country towards the Chuqunaque River [Panama]; having
									no companion through that hostile country but black chainmen.
									He also assisted to bury some men belonging to H.M.S. “Virago”
									under the command of Captain Prevost, who were shot by the
									Indians while he was there; and afterwards accompanied
									Lieutenant Forsyth… for the rescue of Lieutenant Strain, of
									the US Navy, and his missing party, in which they succeeded;
									and for this service, Mr Bennett received the thanks of the
									American Government through the Secretary of the United States
									Navy…"
								</p>
								<p>
									Bennett was appointed Assistant City Engineer in New South
									Wales in 1855 until 1856. He worked under John Whitton, the
									Engineer-in-Chief for Railways from 1857 until 1858 when he
									was selected by Captain Martindale, Commissioner for Internal
									Communication, to superintend the repair of a flood-damaged
									bridge at Bathurst. Martindale was so pleased with the manner
									in which this work was completed that he recommended Bennett
									for the position of Engineer to the Roads Department, to which
									he was appointed in January 1859 to January 1861. After an
									absence of twelve months, in which he returned to England, he
									worked again in the Railway Department under Whitton before
									receiving the appointment of Commissioner and Chief Engineer
									to the Roads Department, which he retained until his
									retirement on 1 July 1889.
								</p>
								<p>
									Bennett was well loved and respected by those who worked for
									him, as can be seen by the collection of letters written to
									him kept at the Mitchell Library. Up to the end of 1888, the
									total length of main roads built by Bennett and his department
									was nearly 16,000 km. About 40 miles (64 km) of bridges had
									been constructed, many of them the largest in the southern
									hemisphere, some remaining today. A former colleague of
									Bennett wrote:
								</p>
								<p class="italic">
									"Our late chief, Mr W.C. Bennett… was a man of singular
									ability, prodigious energy, and untiring industry… The immense
									department which has grown up under Mr Bennett’s control, and
									the work it has done, will probably not be chronicled till it,
									like he, has broken down under the strain, increasing as it
									does from year to year. Both have done their work nobly and
									well; both deserve the honour not always accorded where most
									merited."
								</p>
								<p>
									Bennett designed a great number of very different bridges over
									his career. Four of the metal bridges which demonstrate his
									ability as a bridge designer, making use of many different
									materials and configurations as best suited to the needs of a
									particular site, are described below.
								</p>
								<p>
									The old <strong>Hay Swing Bridge</strong> designed by Bennett
									was completed in February 1873 under contract to the
									Department of Public Works and opened by Mr Henry Parkes on
									29th August 1874. Prior to the railway in 1882 the swing
									bridge at Hay opened for as many as six paddle steamers per
									day, whereas in the whole of 1883 only six steamers passed
									through. When the bridge was replaced with a new concrete and
									steel bridge in 1973, almost 100 years later, the operating
									mechanism of the swing span was handed over to the Hay
									Historical Society and can still be viewed in a nearby park.
								</p>
								<p>
									The <strong>Prince Alfred Bridge</strong> at Gundagai was the
									first metal truss bridge to be built in New South Wales.
									Designed by Bennett and opened in 1867, it is the
									second-oldest metal truss bridge remaining in Australia, and
									carried Hume Highway traffic until it was bypassed in 1977.
									Since that time it has carried local traffic from South
									Gundagai to Gundagai. According to Bennett, the Warren girder
									had been adopted because it required the least workmanship on
									the ground, and because of the rapidity with which it could be
									erected, incurring least risk from the violent floods of the
									Murrumbidgee during construction. The cast iron piers are
									unique because they were cast in at the Fitzroy Iron Works,
									the first ironworks in Australia, chiefly from local ores. By
									1932 there were thoughts to replace the bridge, but it was
									admitted that
									<span class="italic"
										>"the existing iron trusses, though light and of unusual
										design, viewed from the aspect of modern structural
										practice, were in good order and were capable of rendering
										efficient service for the life of at least one more timber
										approach."</span
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									The drawings and detailed calculations for the
									<strong>Denison Bridge over the Macquarie River</strong> in
									Bathurst were made by Gustavus Alphonse Morell, assistant
									engineer to Bennett, and his signature (along with Bennett’s)
									appears on the original design drawings. Opened in 1870,
									Denison Bridge is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in New
									South Wales, and carried Great Western Highway traffic until
									it was bypassed in 1992. Since that time it has continued as a
									pedestrian crossing. The Denison Bridge is detailed in such a
									way that it could be mistaken for a more modern bridge, being
									a Pratt type truss, with the web of the upper chords placed
									horizontally so as to achieve a high transverse bending
									strength and a good resistance to buckling.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Bawden Bridge over the Orara River</strong>
									approximately 16 km south-west of Grafton, was opened in 1874.
									It is particularly notable for its high, heavy metal piers.
									The iron work was constructed at Mort’s Foundry, Sydney, and
									the bridge remains in use today. Although Bennett designed a
									vast number of very different bridges, he felt that wrought
									iron lattice truss bridges were superior where workmen and
									material could be obtained without much difficulty and where
									the flood risk was not as great as at Gundagai, thus his
									wrought iron lattice truss design for Bawden Bridge.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition to his prodigious work on roads and bridges in New
									South Wales, Bennett also made a significant contribution to
									navigation, water supply and sewerage works. In 1852 he
									accepted appointment with Gisborne & Forde to go from Ireland
									to South America and report on the navigation of the Magdalena
									River, its connection with the sea by canal and the
									possibilities of a further canal link with Bogota, capital of
									Nueva Granada (Colombia). As a preliminary he toured the Rhone
									and Saône Rivers in France to study methods of river
									navigation by large boats. After he returned to England from
									Colombia, he helped to plan a proposed embankment for the
									Thames, which was, however, never implemented. In 1853 he
									re-joined Gisborne & Forde in another expedition to Latin
									America, this time in charge of surveying and exploring the
									Pacific side of the Isthmus of Darien for the international
									ship canal. It was there that he also assisted Lieutenant
									Forsythe and a detail from H.M.S. Virago in the hazardous
									rescue of a missing exploration party of United States navy
									personnel under Lieutenant Strain. Interestingly, this
									expedition was written up, illustrated and appeared over three
									successive editions of the 1855
									<span class="italic">Harper’s New Monthly</span>, a periodical
									of the day, with glowing reports of Bennett’s contributions:
								</p>
								<p class="italic">
									"The noble-hearted Bennett… a stranger and foreigner - this
									grand, high purpose to cast his lot in with the distressed
									commander, and save his party, or perish with them – reveals
									one of those lofty, elevated characters which shed lustre on
									the race."
								</p>
								<p>
									After moving to Australia, Bennett was, for a time, assistant
									city engineer on sewage works under Edward Bell. In 1857
									Bennett and a subordinate, W. B. Wade, won a competition for
									designing the Launceston sewerage system. In the field of
									water supply and sewerage in Sydney, Bennett was appointed to
									special commissions in 1868, 1875 and 1888, and two standing
									boards as an additional member. He also served in commissions
									on Sydney's water supply in 1868, on Hunter River floods in
									1869 and on Darling Harbour in 1878, and gave evidence to
									several select committees on various engineering problems.

									<span>Bennett as a young man (source: Manson, 1960)</span>
								</div>
								<p>
									Letters and testimonials from his superiors, subordinates and
									friends indicate that Bennett had great ability both as an
									engineer and as an administrator. In his own words, he was
									“naturally, and by habit, anxious and energetic”. In
									particular he was anxious for assurance of the approval of his
									superiors, and apt to offer resignation if he lacked it. Yet
									he distrusted public approbation and avoided limelight.
									Ambitious in the tasks he was prepared to undertake, he drove
									his subordinates hard but was loyal and generous in return and
									made staunch friends among them. In 1872 Sir Henry Parkes,
									speaking in support of an increase in Bennett's salary to
									£1000, described him in parliament as, “one of the ablest
									officers in the government service” and asserted that he had
									been grossly underpaid for his important and competent work.
									Bennett was diligent to the end, as described in his obituary
									published in the Minutes of Proceedings of The Institution of
									Civil Engineers:
								</p>
								<p class="italic">
									'About the month of March he had an illness, caused by failure
									of action of the heart, when his medical adviser urged him to
									give up the heavy duties he was performing; but being desirous
									of seeing the completion of some important works then in hand,
									he continued on until the month of June, at which date he
									became so seriously ill that he sent in his resignation, and
									retired on his well-earned and ample pension, while the
									Government, in recognition of his able services in carrying
									out the city and suburban sewerage works, submitted to
									Parliament a vote on the Supplementary Estimates for 1888 of
									£2,700, as a gratuity for the supervision of this gigantic
									work, which was readily granted. Unfortunately, he did not
									long survive these advantages, and from the date of his
									retirement was scarcely able to leave his bed. His death took
									place on the 29th of September, 1889'.
